# Chatting with Books using LLM.

The process involves using embeddings, which represent words or sentences as vectors, allowing computers to compare the meaning of different texts. This project uses the OpenAI embeddings API to obtain embeddings and PineCone, a cloud-based vector database, to store and search them.

### Basic Steps:

1. Load our data and split it up into small parts;
2. For each small part, send it to the OpenAI embeddings API and get the embedding back;
3. Store the embedding in a vector database, specifically designed to store and compare/search embeddings;
4. When a user asks a question, convert the question to an embedding and search the vector database for the closest embeddings, indicating that their meaning is related to the userâ€™s question.
