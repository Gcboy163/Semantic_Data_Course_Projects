following the tutorial and did some minor adjustment to fit pc reqs.
OBSERVATION:
increasing sample size increases avg accuracy(10k=0.55(9min) to 15k=0.56(18min) to 20k=0.56(36min)) 

stopped increasing accuracy after 20k, (possible solution) maybe need to increase max_iter or use standard scaler model (didnt try due to long computing time)

(please refer to text filesfor more details tq)
