### :bulb: Description for each part:

1. **Paper_Presentations**: We made two paper presentations, one is about <u>**a new algorithm for data compression**</u> and the other is about <u>**improving language understanding by generative pre-training**</u>. Both presentations are in the `01-Paper_Presentations` directory.

2. **Markovify_Project**: We made two single projects for the Markovify library to generate sometext from corpus. All projects are in the `02-Markovify_Project` directory.

3. **Movie_Reviews_Classification**: We made three single notebooks for classifying movie reviews into different categories. All notebooks are in the `03-Movie_Reviews_Classification` directory.

4. **LLM_Tricks**: We made and found out two different tries for Large Language Model tricks which can bypass the security mechanism of language models. Both notes are in the `04-LLM_Tricks` directory.

5. **Final_Project**: We made a final project about a chatbot that can let user chat with large documents. The project is in the `05-Final_Project` directory.
